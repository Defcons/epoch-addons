# AuxTSMBridge — Changelog

## v1.0 — Initial Release

- Registers two TSM price sources: `AuxMarket` (weighted median) and `AuxMinBuyout` (daily low)
- Auto-syncs all Aux scanned prices into TSM AuctionDB when the Auction House closes (throttled to once per 12 real hours, persisted across sessions via `AuxTSMBridgeDB` SavedVariable)
- Calculates weighted median with exponential time decay (`0.99^days_ago`), replicating Aux's own algorithm
- Parses Aux's raw history strings directly instead of calling `auxHistory.value()` in a loop — the latter goes through Aux's temp-table allocator (`T.lua`) and causes `memory allocation error: block too big` when called thousands of times synchronously outside Aux's execution context
- Slash commands: `/axtsm sync` (force immediate sync, resets the 12-hour timer), `/axtsm status`

### Bug fixes
- `quantity = 0` written during sync encoded to TSM's sentinel `"~"` which decodes back to `nil`; TSM's tooltip then calls `format("%d auctions", nil)` and crashes — fixed by defaulting to `1` in the bridge and adding `or 0` guard in `TradeSkillMaster_AuctionDB.lua`
- `AUCTION_HOUSE_CLOSED` fires twice in 3.3.5 (Aux hides its frame in the same event, re-triggering it); the 12-hour cooldown naturally absorbs the double-fire
- Removed noisy login message "Registered AuxMarket and AuxMinBuyout as TSM price sources"
