# ItemRackOptions — Changelog

## v2.243 — Ascension/Epoch Modifications

### New feature — "Disable in BG/Arena" checkbox in Sets panel
- Added `"Disable in BG/Arena"` label string to `ItemRack.CheckButtonLabels`
- Added `ItemRackOptSetsNoBGCheckButton` (20×20, `ItemRackOptSimpleCheckButton` template) anchored below the Hide checkbox in `ItemRackOptSubFrame2`
- `ItemRackOpt.NoBGSet()` function reads checkbox state and writes/clears `NoBG` on the active set
- Checkbox is disabled when no set is selected; enabled and synced to saved value when a set is loaded
- Increased Sets panel frame height to accommodate new checkbox

### Bug fix — "stop queue here" always available for all slots
- `PopulateSortList()`: unconditionally calls `AddToSortList(sortList, 0)` after the item loop
- Previously the `0` sentinel ("-- stop queue here --") was only added when `AllowEmpty=="ON"` AND the slot had an item equipped AND the bank was closed — meaning slot 14 (bottom trinket) would often be missing the stop marker
- Since `AddToSortList` deduplicates, this is safe to call unconditionally
